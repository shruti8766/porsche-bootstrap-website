💫 About This Project
It's not the best website out there, but it's MY website that showcases everything I've learned about Bootstrap. It's not perfect, but it's my favorite because every line of code represents a step in my learning journey. I'm still on this path, still discovering, still growing as a developer.

This project is my love letter to Bootstrap 5 - a sleek, dark-themed Porsche website where I've poured every Bootstrap concept I've mastered so far. It might not win any design awards, but it's built with passion, curiosity, and countless hours of learning.

🎨 Design Philosophy
I chose Porsche as my theme because, like my coding journey, it represents precision, evolution, and the pursuit of excellence. The black theme reflects the sophistication I'm striving for in my development skills.

Every section of this website teaches me something new:

The hero section taught me about responsive images

The model cards showed me the power of Bootstrap's grid

The carousel made me understand component JavaScript

The tabs revealed the beauty of interactive content

The timeline demonstrated creative uses of utility classes

 Add more interactive animations

 Implement Bootstrap's modal components

 Create a contact form with validation

 Add more advanced Bootstrap components

 Learn Bootstrap's customization with Sass
